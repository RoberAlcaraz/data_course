    "\n",
    " - The Python interpreter that the virtual environment runs on\n",
    " - A folder containing third-party libraries (site-packages) installed in the virtual environment\n",
    " \n",
    "These virtual environments are isolated from the other virtual environments, which means any changes on dependencies installed in a virtual environment don’t affect the dependencies of the other virtual environments or the system-wide libraries. \n",
    "\n",

    "# Why should I use Virtualenvs\n",
    "The importance of Python virtual environments becomes apparent when we have various Python projects on the same machine that depend on different versions of the same packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other use case that magnifies the importance of using Python virtual environments is when you’re working on managed servers or production environments where you can’t modify the system-wide packages because of specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python virtual environments create isolated contexts to keep dependencies required by different projects separate so they don’t interfere with other projects or system-wide packages. Basically, setting up virtual environments is the best way to isolate different Python projects, especially if these projects have different and conflicting dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a piece of advice for new Python programmers, **always set up a separate virtual environment for each Python project**, and install all the required dependencies inside it — never install packages globally."
